## The Poisson distribution

Suppose we have rare events that occur at varying times but at a steady rate. 

A classic example is radioactive decay. At any instant, I can't tell you if a 
particle will be detected. But if you tell me the isotopic half-life, I can 
guess how many events you'll see in a day, year, or century. If the intensity
of decay is $\lambda$, we can reason about its emissions $X$.

We say $X \sim Pois(\lambda)$: "$X$ is Poisson with intensity $\lambda$".

$$
\begin{align}
E\left[X\right] &= \lambda \\
Var\left[X\right] &= \lambda \\
Pr(X=k|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^{k}}{k!}e^{-\lambda}
\end{align}
$$

## The exponential distribution

Suppose instead of the _number_ of events $X$, we track _time_ between events as
$Y$. 

Then $Y \sim Exp(\lambda)$: "$Y$ is exponential with intensity $\lambda$".

$$
E\left[Y\right] = \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

The probability of $k$ events per observation $X$ is 
$Pr(\sum^{k}_{i=1}Y_i \leq 1)$:

$$
\begin{align}
Pr(0|\lambda) &= e^{-\lambda} \\
Pr(1|\lambda) &= \lambda e^{-\lambda} \\
Pr(2|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^2}{2!} e^{-\lambda} \\
... \\
Pr(k|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} e^{-\lambda}
\end{align}
$$

## Poisson / exponential demo

If the probability of an event per unit observation $\lambda = \frac{1}{10}$, 
the mean number of observations between events will be $\frac{1}{\lambda} = 10$.

```{webr}
n = 1000
lambda = 0.1
Y = rexp(n=n, rate=lambda)
mean(Y) - (1 / lambda) # small number
hist(Y)
```

## The Gamma distribution

Suppose we have $j$ exponentially distributed processes $Y_j \sim Exp(\lambda)$.

If $Z = \sum^{j}_{i=1} Y_j$, we can model the sum as $Z \sim Gamma(j, \lambda)$:

$$
\begin{align}
E\left[Z\right] &= \sum^{j}_{i=1} E\left[Y_j\right] = \frac{j}{\lambda} \\
Var\left[Z\right] &= \sum^{j}_{i=1} Var\left[Y_j\right] = \frac{j}{\lambda^2}\\
Pr(Z=z|j,\lambda) &= \frac{z^{j-1}e^{-z/\lambda}}{\lambda^j\Gamma(j)}, 
                     \text{where}\ \Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!
\end{align}
$$

## Gamma-Poisson distribution: background

Now we have the pieces to reconstruct a Poisson process across discrete samples.
We can reason about how variable $\lambda$ really is, both within and across 
samples, using a model that captures the sampling distribution of $\lambda$.

Suppose we look at inherited genetic variants in the general population; in a 
disease; and in a specific type or age group of disease. We might wonder whether
the rates of inherited genetic variants (of any sort!) are in each group, and 
we might wonder how strong the evidence is for differences between groups. But
if the disease is rare, we know that our estimate of $\lambda$ cannot be as 
precise as it would be if the disease was common, because we simply don't have 
as many observations. The Gamma-Poisson distribution helps us represent this 
inherent imprecision in our simulations and reason a

## Gamma-Poisson distribution: simple case

Let's make our examples concrete by looking at germline genetic variants in 
an unselected control population, versus genetic variants in leukemia patients.
We will assume that clinically relevant genetic variants are somewhat rare, but
previous studies have confirmed that at least 5% of leukemia patients harbor 
inherited genetic variants which are rare in the general population.

## Gamma-Poisson distribution: more uses

Recall that one type of Gamma distribution is the sum of exponential processes.

A statistical model for graph traversal is the exponential random graph model, 
or Erdos-Renyi model, where the number of edges (connections) from any given
node (such as a gene, or a protein-protein interaction) is exponential. 

Since the sum of traversal times for disconnected graph components is a sum of
exponential processes under this random graph model, we can test the hypothesis
that the intensity of emissions ("hops" before hitting a gene variant, whether 
inherited or acquired) is the same across disease subtypes, and we can do this 
with an amended graph that reflects any protein-protein fusions in a patient:
