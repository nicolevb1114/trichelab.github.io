## The binomial distribution, part I

Suppose I want to model _whether_ something happens (1 if so, 0 otherwise).
For example, whether someone is admitted to a UC Berkeley graduate program.
We might want to model the importance of factors to the outcome probability $p$.
One way to do this is with a binomial variable $X \sim Bin(n, p)$, where
the number of individuals applying is $n$, the probability of admission is $p$, 
and $X \sim Bin(n, p)$, where $p$ might depend on gender, department & skills.
Skills for graduate research are notoriously difficult to quantify, so we might
instead ask whether gender bias is uncomfortably good at predicting admission.

$$
\begin{align}
Pr(X = k | n, p) &= \binom{n}{k} p^{k} \left( 1 - p \right)^{n-k} \\
\binom{n}{k} &= \frac{n!}{k! \left( n - k \right)!} \\
E\left[X\right] &= np \\
Var\left[X\right] &= np(1-p)
\end{align}
$$

## The binomial distribution, part II

Recall from the previous slide that a series of successes or failures can be 
modeled as $X \sim Bin(n, p)$.  If we model $p$ and use the _logistic_ function,
$\text{logit}(p) = log\frac{p}{1-p}$, we can perform _logistic regression_. 

Since $\text{logit}(p)$ can potentially be infinite, we can't perform a least-
squares fit the way we might for a linear model. But we can finesse this by
maximizing the likelihood (joint probability of seeing the observed data). And 
that means we can model $p$ as a function of multiple predictors, like we would
in a multivariate linear model. 

In the next slide we will see an example. For more on maximum likelihood and 
logistic models, [see this notebook](https://rpubs.com/ttriche/1011627).

### Logistic regression, part 1

Let's model the importance of sex in graduate admissions at Berkeley.
The `UCBAdmissions` data is included with R, in the `datasets` library.
*(Need to modify this a bit to reflect the use of Freq rather than 0/1).*

```{webr}
class(UCBAdmissions)
berk.data = as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
berk.data$Gender = relevel(berk.data$Gender, ref='Female')
berk.data$Dept = relevel(berk.data$Dept, ref='F')
berk.data$Outcome = with(berk.data, ifelse(Admit == "Admitted", 1, 0))
berk.fit = glm(Outcome ~ Gender + Dept, family=binomial(), data=berk.data)

```

## Binomial approximations

A rule of thumb is that if $X ~ Bin(n, p)$, $n \geq 20$, and $p \leq .05$, then
$X \approx Poisson(\lambda = np)$. This is handy for modeling counts of events,
as we shall soon see. First, an introduction to the Poisson distribution, then
we will see how combinations of counts can be predicted with this model. 

--- 



## The Poisson distribution

Suppose we have events that occur at varying times but at a steady rate. 

A classic example is radioactive decay. At any instant, I can't tell you if a 
particle will be detected. But if you tell me the isotopic half-life, I can 
guess how many events you'll see in a day, year, or century. If the intensity
of decay is $\lambda$, we can reason about its emissions $X$.

We say $X \sim Pois(\lambda)$: "$X$ is Poisson with intensity $\lambda$".

$$
\begin{align}
E\left[X\right] &= \lambda \\
Var\left[X\right] &= \lambda \\
Pr(X=k|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^{k}}{k!}e^{-\lambda}
\end{align}
$$

---



## The exponential distribution

Suppose instead of _number_ of events, $X$, we track _time_ between events, $Y$.

Then $Y \sim Exp(\lambda)$: "$Y$ is exponential with intensity $\lambda$".

$$
E\left[Y\right] = \frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

The probability of $k$ events per observation $X$ is 
$Pr(\sum^{k}_{i=1}Y_i \leq 1)$:

$$
\begin{align}
Pr(0|\lambda) &= e^{-\lambda} \\
Pr(1|\lambda) &= \lambda e^{-\lambda} \\
Pr(2|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^2}{2!} e^{-\lambda} \\
... \\
Pr(k|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} e^{-\lambda}
\end{align}
$$

---



## Binomial / Poisson / exponential demo

If the probability of an event per unit observation $\lambda = \frac{1}{10}$, 
the mean number of observations between events will be $\frac{1}{\lambda} = 10$.

```{webr}
n = 1000
lambda = 0.1
Y = rexp(n=n, rate=lambda)
mean(Y) - (1 / lambda) # small number
hist(Y)
```

## The Gamma distribution

Suppose we have $j$ exponentially distributed processes $Y_j \sim Exp(\lambda)$.

If $Z = \sum^{j}_{i=1} Y_j$, we can model the sum as $Z \sim Gamma(j, \lambda)$:

$$
\begin{align}
E\left[Z\right] &= \sum^{j}_{i=1} E\left[Y_j\right] = \frac{j}{\lambda} \\
Var\left[Z\right] &= \sum^{j}_{i=1} Var\left[Y_j\right] = \frac{j}{\lambda^2}\\
Pr(Z=z|j,\lambda) &= \frac{z^{j-1}e^{-z/\lambda}}{\lambda^j\Gamma(j)}, 
                     \text{where}\ \Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!
\end{align}
$$

Recall: if $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$, $t(x_{i+1}) - t(x_i) \sim Exp(\lambda)$.

---


## Gamma-Poisson background I

Now we have the pieces to reconstruct a Poisson process across discrete samples.
We can reason about how precise our estimate of $\lambda$ is, within and across 
samples, using a model that captures the sampling distribution of $\lambda$.

The likelihood $\mathcal{L}(\theta|X)$ of model parameters $\theta$ is the joint
probability of seeing the data $X$ if $\theta$ describes the generating process.
Note: it's easier to compute $\ell(\theta|X) = log(\mathcal{L}(\theta|X))$.

So if $X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$, the only parameter in $\theta$ is $\lambda$. If
we label each of $n$ observations as $x_i$, then

$$
\begin{align}
Pr(x_i|\lambda) &= \frac{\lambda^{x_i}e^{\lambda}}{x_i!}, for i \in 1,\cdots,n\\
\mathcal{L}(\lambda|X) &= Pr(X|\lambda) \\
                       &= \prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\lambda^{x_i}e^{\lambda}}{x_i!}\\
\ell(\lambda|X) &= log(\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\lambda^{x_i}e^{\lambda}}{x_i!}) \\
                &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} log(
\end{align}
$$

It would be nice to have some way to relate this to our sample size $n$. Luckily
for us, we will accomplish that using the Gamma distribution in the next slide.

---



## Gamma-Poisson background II

Suppose that the sole parameter in our Poisson model, $\lambda$, itself has some
randomness to it. A natural model for this is the Gamma distribution:

$$
\begin{align}
\end{align}
$$

It would be nice to have some way to relate this to our sample size $n$. Luckily
for us, we will accomplish that using the Gamma distribution in the next slide.

## Gamma-Poisson example 1

Suppose we look at inherited genetic variants in the general population; in a 
disease; and in a specific type or age group of disease. We might wonder whether
the rates of inherited genetic variants (of any sort!) are in each group, and 
we might wonder how strong the evidence is for differences between groups. But
if the disease is rare, we know that our estimate of $\lambda$ cannot be as 
precise as it would be if the disease was common, because we simply don't have 
as many observations. The Gamma-Poisson distribution helps us represent this 
inherent imprecision in our simulations and reason about how that affects our
comparisons.

--- 



## Gamma-Poisson: simple case

Let's make our examples concrete by looking at germline genetic variants in 
an unselected control population, versus genetic variants in leukemia patients.
We will assume that clinically relevant genetic variants are somewhat rare, but
previous studies have reported that at least 5% of leukemia patients harbor 
inherited genetic variants which are rare in the general population. 

--- 



## Gamma-Poisson: more uses

Recall that one type of Gamma distribution is the sum of exponential processes.

A statistical model for graph traversal is the exponential random graph model, 
or Erdos-Renyi model, where the number of edges (connections) from any given
node (such as a gene, or a protein-protein interaction) is exponential. 

Since the sum of traversal times for disconnected graph components is a sum of
exponential processes under this random graph model, we can test the hypothesis
that the intensity of emissions ("hops" before hitting a gene variant, whether 
inherited or acquired) is the same across disease subtypes, and we can do this 
with an amended graph that reflects any protein-protein fusions in a patient:
