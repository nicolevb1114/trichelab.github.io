    The circuit starts at Crescent Park, near VAI, but you can skip
    to Calder Plaza (La Grande Vitesse is the name of the sculpture)
    if you are walking from downtown (as from the Hyatt City Place).

    An umbrella would be a good idea if thunderheads are brewing.

    This route avoids vehicle traffic and is wheelchair accessible.
    You will also pass Fish Ladder Park and numerous art installations
    which could not be explicitly included owing to Google's limit on 
    destinations for Maps routes. From Sixth Street Park, one can go
    north to Riverside Park, east to Lookout Park, or south to downtown.

    People have lived in the Grand River valley for over 2000 years.
    The <a href="https://anishinaabecircle.org/">Anishinaabe Circle</a>
    supports communities that have called this place home for millenia.
