    This route avoids vehicle traffic and is wheelchair accessible.
    You will also pass Fish Ladder Park and numerous art installations
    which could not be explicitly included owing to Google's limit on 
    destinations for Maps routes. From Sixth Street Park, one can go
    north to Riverside Park, east to Lookout Park, or south to downtown.
