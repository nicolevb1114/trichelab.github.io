## Background: identical twins aren't

It is not uncommon for a genetic condition to show unexplained heterogeneity,
that is, the same variant produces different effects in isogenic individuals. 
A <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/585814/pearson-twins/">striking example</a> comes from neurofibromatosis type 1, a monogenic condition. 
Adam and Neil Pearson both carry the same variant in the _NF1_ gene, but while
Neil's symptoms are invisible, Neil's are very nearly the opposite. 

Here we will look at a larger cohort of identical (monozygotic) twins to study
discordant phenotypes such as weight and muscle mass using mixture models. The


```{webr-r}

library(mixR)
#library(bifurcatoR) # not needed for webR demo
 
# for interactive usage; identical to data(UKtwins, package="bifurcatoR")
UKtwins <- list(
  pairs = read.csv(url("https://trichelab.github.io/data/mzpairs.csv"), row=1),
  pheno = read.csv(url("https://trichelab.github.io/data/mzpheno.csv"), row=1),
  exprs = read.csv(url("https://trichelab.github.io/data/mzexprs.csv"), row=1)
)
# top 5000 gene symbols by row-wise SD; deltas between matchable MZ twins. 

```

The preceding data is from monozygotic (identical) twins of varying age. We 
can get an idea of how long the twins have had to diverge based on how old 
they were when the measurements were taken.

# Be sure to run the previous chunks!
